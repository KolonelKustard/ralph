	<para>Media such as vinyl and magnetic tape all had their flaws. By
		storing data in analogue form on analogue media, degradation begins to
		distort and fragment content. Digital media such as CD's are reputed
		to be free from degradation and decomposition. Digital data stored on
		impervious media. But is this completely true?
	</para>
	<para>The BitRot Media Player translates the process a vinyl record
		undergoes to the virtual space. Now, when video and audio is viewed
		and listened to, a certain amount of the original will be lost through
		degradation.</para>
