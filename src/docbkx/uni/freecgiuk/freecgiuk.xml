	<para>Free CGI-UK is a hoax web site intended to entice Internet users
		to fill out its form. The site offers free CGI hosting for a variety
		of server side protocols. Once the user has filled in their details,
		they are added to the database and enlisted to take part in the Free
		CGI-UK project.</para>
	<imagedata fileref="images/screenshot1.gif" />
	<para>The project aims to attack current mis-conceptions of Free.
		Nothing is truely free. 2 for the price of 1 inevitably means another
		item becomes more expensive. Free web space means forced advertising.
		The list goes on.</para>
	<para>Free is simply a marketing tool used to entice customers into
		inadvertantly spending money.</para>
	<para>So when a user signs up for Free CGI-UK, why should anything be
		any different? Free CGI-UK need to make money too...</para>

		<title>Free CGI-UK - About</title>
		<para>The idea of exchange has been the foundation for modern
			economics. In a modern state run market based economy, currency is
			exchanged for goods or services. The state is then responsible for
			managing the market and ensuring fair trading and lawfulness. The
			Internet, because of its global nature, has no governing body.
			Therefore there is no inherent protection of property rights. On the
			Internet, otherwise lawful people lose any sense of lawfulness.
			Hobbyists who would have no intentions of robbing a bank in
			actuality, are quite prepared to hack into a bank in virtuality. This
			has led to any traders in the Internet being responsible for their
			own security, and their own protection of property. This has shaped
			the modern web server.</para>
		<para>The web server can be likened to a medieval fortress. Security
			quite often is the most important feature of a web server, overriding
			speed and efficiency. Users of the Internet are only ever permitted
			to view a tiny proportion of a web server, similar to the fortress
			having an open market. Only the permitted privileged few can have
			further levels of access, depending on either their status, or how
			much they are willing to exchange. This limits the inhabitants of a
			fortress to friends and family of the owner, and the wealthy. In the
			case of the web server, this is employees and the paying customer.
		</para>
		<para>Web hosting companies find it difficult to make money in
			virtuality. This is because there is no tangible property in virtual
			space, and therefore no sense of value.</para>
		<para>In order for web hosting companies to make money, the majority
			will rely on aspects of actuality. This could be offering free web
			hosting, but forcing advertising onto users. Or offering free web
			hosting as long as users dial up through a particular account. In
			order for web hosting companies to gain paying customers they often
			resort to offering the hosting for free and getting money from
			customers in other means. The number of 'free' web hosting companies
			offering greater and greater privileges, but with more and more
			catches, is phenomenal.</para>
		<para>I would argue that all users in virtuality have the right to
			freedom with no repercussions. A visitor to virtuality is escaping
			actuality, and as such should be removed entirely from any direct
			links to actuality. Because of this, I have decided to base my
			project on perverting the existing free systems.</para>
		<para>I have created a hoax web hosting company that are offering
			users massive privileges for their web sites. The company (Free CGI
			UK - www.freecgiuk.co.uk) will in turn be expecting something back
			from their users. The automated Free CGI UK server does this in a
			number of ways.</para>
		<para>Firstly, the user will be phoned and asked to make an
			appointment for a representative of Free CGI UK to visit. Once they
			have done this, a letter of confirmation will be posted and e-mail
			sent. Free CGI UK will need to do this, as the users property will
			become their method of payment.</para>

		<title>Free CGI-UK - Application</title>
		<para>The execution of this project has been limited to just the
			registering and phone calling elements. I left out the e-mailed
			responses and letters of confirmation to concentrate my time on the
			telephone application.</para>
		<para>
			<link linkend="theSite">The web site</link>
			is the method of registration. A user visits the Free CGI UK web site
			and registers their interest for the service, filling in address and
			phone number.
		</para>
		<imagedata fileref="images/screenshot1.gif" />
		<para>These details are then added to a database and used later by the
			telephone application.</para>
		<para>The telephone application takes the list of users, and
			sequentially phones them up, one after the other. The user answers
			the phone, and is greeted by the machine saying:</para>
		<para>
			"Hello
			<emphasis>*users name*</emphasis>
			from Free CGI UK. Thank you for registering with us. We are very
			grateful for your interest. In order for your application to be
			completed we will need to evaluate your property. When would be a
			suitable time for one of our representatives to visit?"
		</para>
		<para>The machine will then listen for a response, record the resonse,
			and reply with the following:</para>
		<para>
			"Thank you from Free C G I UK. We will be in contact with you
			regarding your appointment for
			<emphasis>*users response*</emphasis>
			. Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding Free C G I
			UK?"
		</para>
		<para>Following this, it will then have a conversation with the user
			until the allotted 2 minute maximum call length is reached, after
			which it will say goodbye and hang up.</para>
		<para>This process is entirely automated using a combination of voice
			modem management, speech recognition, text to speech and the ALICE
			chat bot.</para>
		<para>The application is installed using 2 computers. One PC runs the
			phone management application using the Microsoft JDK (Java
			Development Kit) with the Microsoft TAPI (Telephony Application
			Programming Interface) version 3 for Windows 2000. Another PC uses
			the communications application which runs the Sun JDK using the Chant
			SpeechKit 2.1.2 which implements an interface to the Microsoft SAPI
			(Speech Application Programming Interface) version 4. This
			application also runs the ALICE chat bot version b for Java.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>The applications are very difficult to set up and run. They
			require 2 TCP/IP networked IBM compatible PC's. The phone app
			requires Windows 2000, and the communications app requires any
			Windows 95+ or Windows NT4+ platform. The 2 machines must be linked
			together with a pair of audio cables too. This is from the speaker
			out to the line in of both machines.</para>
		<para>If the applications are installed successfully, they will run
			through the list of users automatically, requiring no supervision.
