## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer and Manager at Expedia, London *May 2013 to present*

I lead a global team spread between Seattle, Chicago, London, Hungary and Delhi. We deliver a suite of libraries and
tools used by Expedia for analytics and experimentation (A/B testing).

We supply an elegant and simple to use SDK for the engineering teams to capture over 10,000 user interactions per
second. Our tooling publishes this click-stream data is internally to realtime Kafka based streams and S3 based
buckets for batch processing. The internal data then drives a variety of external systems such as Adobe Analytics
(Omniture). We further enrich the data in the pipeline adding key metrics such as cross device identification.

Additionally we provide tools for teams to deliver feature gates and A/B tests processing over 70,000 experiment
exposures a second. Taking responsiblity for the entire experiment lifecycle our tools also analyse the results of those
experiments in a near-realtime dashboard.

As a senior engineer I enjoy delivering elegant, simple to use and understand solutions designed to work at scale.
Whilst having a focus on being an all-rounder I am able to pick up new programming languages and frameworks very
rapidly. At present I spend most of my time in Scala, Java and JavaScript whilst using Spark, Storm, Spring, Git, CI/CD,
DynamoDB, MongoDB and too many other tools to list.

As a manager of a global engineering team I rely on my team to deliver our vision. By enocuraging ownership and autonomy
my focus is to help steer the team toward success and grow each individual toward their goals. Key to our success is
maintaining a strong relationship with the needs of the business. It's my job to make sure the rest of the team are not
detached from their place in Expedia's success.

### Travelling, Worldwide *Apr. 2012 to May 2013*

My wife and I took a career break exploring Europe in a campervan and backpacking in Morocco and South America. Along
